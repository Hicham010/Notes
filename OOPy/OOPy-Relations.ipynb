Each player throws two die and move some pawns on the board. Design proper attributes, methods and implement some of the methods. For example, implement \"the player throws the die and based on the numbers, move two pawns\". Hint: the purpose of this exercise is not to build the whole game. Focus on designing properties, behaviours and how you can use them.\n",
