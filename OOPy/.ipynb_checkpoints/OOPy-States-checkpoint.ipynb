    "# Object Oriented Modeling: State Machine Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "In this note we will introduce State Machine Diagrams (SMDs) as a diagram that specifies the *behaviour* of an object, subsystem, system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the state of an object and transitions between the states are the main points of its behaviour to study (to model). Lets consider the following cases:\n",
    "- “A light can be either ON or OFF. A switch controls the light. If the light is ON/OFF, flipping the switch turns it into OFF/ON.”\n",
    "- “A task can be in one of these states: Pending, Processing, Done. A Pending task turns into Processing when there is enough resources, otherwise it stays as Pending. When it is completed, it is defined as Done.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Class diagrams can specify static aspects of an entity. It defines the classes and relationships. For the examples above, we can define classes Light and Task. But, how can we specify / model the behaviour of the created objects from these classes? How can we specify that what happens to the objects during their lifetime? What kind of triggers / events they response? \n",
    "In this note we will study state machine diagrams which is useful to model the behaviour of an entity regarding their states and transitions. State Machine Diagrams are heavily used to specify: Real-time / Mission-Critical systems, e.g. Defense Systems; Special-purpose devices, like ATM; Games.\n",
    "\n",
    "## States, Transitions, SMD\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Statechart Diagram (State Machine Diagram) specifies the behaviour of an object in terms of its states and transitions between the states. A state is a *condition or situation* during the life of an object during which it *satisfies some conditions*, *performs some activities*, or *waits for some events*. State machine is a specification of the sequences of states that an object or an interaction goes through in response to events during its life, together with its responsive effects (action and activity).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A light can be either ON or OFF. Two buttons controls the light: turn on, turn off. If the light is ON/OFF, turning off/on turns it into OFF/ON.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UML**:\n",
    "- Class Diagram: The specification can be simply modeled in one class: Light.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./oopy-images/oopy-light-class.png\" alt=\"A class Light in UML\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "- State Machine Diagram: The following model specifies the state machine diagram specifying the behaviour. The diagram consists of two states. Transitions are modeled through arrows that start from a source state into a destination state. Each transition specifies how the object responses to the event / trigger.\n",
    "\n",
